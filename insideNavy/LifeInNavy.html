<h4 class="title"> Life at Ship :-</h4>
<div class="ship" data-aos="fade-up">
    <p class="para">A far cry from duty ashore, challenges and responsibilities are the hallmark of life at sea. At sea, the Captain leads his team of officers and sailors. In the “good old days”, ships were propelled by sails harnessing the power of the winds. Work on ships involved extensive rope-work, swabbing decks and polishing brass. But today’s ships have specialist sensor operators, guided missiles, homing torpedoes, complex machinery and state-of-the art communication networks etc.</p>

    <p class="para">Work on board ships is divided amongst teams that do different kinds of jobs. They could be involved in the operation of various equipment such as radars, sonars or communications, or firing of weapons such as missiles, guns, or rockets. Other diverse teams involve Chefs, Stewards, Medical Assistants and others who are additionally trained to work with weapons. For each naval personnel, skills, knowledge, abilities, resolve, physical and mental toughness are put to test at sea. ‘Sea duty’ does not mean being at sea at all times. Each ship will have its own ‘home-port’ and personnel spend a fair amount of time in or close to the port. At sea, personnel visit far-flung places in India and abroad, which may only have been read or heard about. While you are at sea, the Navy looks after the welfare of your family like its own.</p>

    <p class="para">Modern ships, submarines and aircraft of the Indian Navy are highly sophisticated and technologically advanced platforms. Onboard ships, men are involved in operating the state-of-the art weapons, navigational systems, communication sets, diving equipment, etc. It involves maintenance of equipment. Personnel go through training in the art of seamanship, operating weapons and sensors, look-out duties, boat-work and man-management. All personnel are also trained in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Warfare and Damage Control including Fire Fighting.</p>

    <p class="para">Of course, sea duty does not mean you will spend all your time at sea. Your ship will have its own ‘home-port’ and you will spend a fair amount of your time in or close to that port. At sea, you will be excited to visiting far-flung places in India and abroad, which you may have only read or heard about.</p>

    <p class="para">Whether on a ship or submarine, sailors are provided with sufficient living spaces. Each sailor is assigned a “berthing area,” which includes a locker for storage, as well as a “bunk” for sleeping. The chefs in the galleys (kitchen) constantly prepare food for hundreds of men. There are dining halls for the men to dine. Mess decks are not just areas to sleep, but are also for recreation – sailors can kick back and watch television or play games.</p>

The major responsibility of the submarines in peace time is to train for war as effectively as possible, in the knowledge that this will contribute to its prevention. On successful completion of rigorous training, one becomes a proud possessor of the ‘Dolphin Badge” and a member of a very elite arm of the Navy.</p>

    <p class="para">Submarines of the Indian Navy are highly sophisticated and technologically advanced platforms. On board submarines, men work with state-of-the art weapons, navigational systems, communication sets, diving equipment, etc. The art of submarine warfare involves having a good understanding of own capabilities and limitations and be able to turn them to own advantage.
